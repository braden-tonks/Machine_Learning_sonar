The end goal of this prroject is to build a laser system guided by Sonar.

Current Ideas:
* Implement a basic state to take measurements from in order to teach the Machine Learning Algorithm.
* Maybe use joystick to give good data for it to use.
* Create a stronger mounting system for the sonar to be more accurate.
